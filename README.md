ChatBot analysis using machine learning models

The main objective is to analyse the responses sent in to the mental health forum to the NGO.

sheet1.csv contains 80 user responses, in the response_text column, to a therapy chatbot. Bot said: 'Describe a time when you have acted as a resource for someone else'. User responded. If a response is 'not flagged', the user can continuetalking to the bot. If it is 'flagged', the user is referred to help.

The steps involved in the project are:

1. exploring the dataset also visualizing as well as cleaning the data set.

2. Data preprocessing

3. building machine learning models

4. evaluating the models

5. tuning the parameters for better accuracy

6. final model creation and analysis outcome.

Final result of analysis:
The accuracy obtained is 0.7 (Naive Bayes algorithm)
